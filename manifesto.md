1.  Purpose/Mission/Description of the club:

    To encourage an interest and passion for programming in the students at OPRF.

1.  How is this club different than any other similar club currently at OPRFHS? Give specific examples.

    - Robotics Club:

      Robotics is more broad than just general programming; there's also mechanical engineering and everything that comes with that.

    - Video Game Club:

      It's technology/computer related, but not programming related much at all.

1.  When will you meet? Include day of the week, time, and location.

    Possibly monday at 3:15, the computer lab in the tutoring center looks promising for a location.

1.  Who will be a part of this activity? Are these students also involved in other clubs/activities/sports?

    See end

1.  Goal of the activity:

    To encourage an interest in programming, help students learn programming, and collaborate on projects determined by students

1.  Ideas for events, activities, and/or philanthropy:

    Working on projects together on GitHub, going to hackathons together, having a [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) clan.

1.  How will this activity impact our student body?

    It will encourage more students to get involved in a STEM activity, which is something they might not have come in contact with outside of Hour of Code or D97 middle school design/robotics/engineering.

1.  How will this activity impact our school and community?

    OPRF has very few STEM clubs/activities/classes. This club will show that the school can prepare students for a possible twenty-first century career path, and a vital skill in any case. In addition, many people have expressed surprise that there does not already exist a programming club at OPRF.

1.  What strides have already been made to create this activity?

    I emailed the student activity center over the summer for information about how to start a club, and confirmed a sponsor before the last school year ended. I also contacted the proprietor of Code Play Learn on Ridgeland and Lake Avenues regarding his ideas, if any, for what the club could be.

1.  What resources will this activity need to be successful?

    Just a computer space should be enough, and for a few specific websites to be unblocked from the school's network.

1.  What obstacles do you foresee experiencing for this potential new activity?

    Teaching students to code that haven't really had much experience might be difficult, but I think we should pull through, and students that catch on quickly will be able to help others learn.

1.  What will you do to recruit and maintain members in your club?

    Make regular announcements about it, give people examples of what projects we're doing, advertise in STEM-y classes e.g. CS, video game design, math.

1.  What other information would be important or interesting for the committee to know about this new activity?

    I'm planning on using a [GitHub](https://github.com/) organization to manage our projects and members; that may or may not require some sort of permission from the school or parents?
